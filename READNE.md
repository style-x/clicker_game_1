# Clicker Game 1

This is a Test for a simple Clicker Game

## Getting Started

_(Note: this is still a TEST)_

Clone this repo and install dependencies with `npm install`.

### Starting The Dev Server

To start the server and start hacking, run

```BASH
npm start
```

This starter uses webpack-dev-server to spin up an Express server with Hot-Reloading capability. Changes to code in `.src` should cause pages to reload.
